# Compass gives you Query API superpowers ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is the starter template for a Next.js application for the "Compass gives you Query API superpowers" workshop at MongoDB World.

## Getting started

To work with this project, you will need to have a working Node.js installation.

Install the required dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You should now be able to connect to `http://localhost:3000/` and see the web application up and running.

Next.js sets up live reload, which makes it easy to develop and see the changes in the browser right away.

## Additional resources

 * If you want to deploy the application online to show it to your friends and colleagues, you can set up automatic deployment on `git push` with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) in just a few clicks.
